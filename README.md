# Flash
Flash began the craze of putting animations into websites. It is older and no longer supported by most browsers yet it is still in many things. The internet continues to build and despite it being an old tech, it is still used infrequently. JS libraries which helped people move away from flash and Apple deciding not to code it into their broswers continued to allow it become extinct. HTML5 helped bury it further into being obsolete. 
# Video and audio
In order for the video to have controls, you need to code that in...otherwise you cannot play, pause video. As a user this is annoying. This is no universal video playback so you need to code native controls for each browser used...which is tiresome. You will use HTML, JS, and CSS to accomplish a functioning video control. JS uses the 'click' adventlistener to help it work. It is a helpful API but worth it for looks and functionality.
